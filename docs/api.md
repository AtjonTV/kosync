# API

KOsync implements the same API as the official Server.  
This is an obvious requirement.

You can find my OpenAPI specification [here](api/KOsync.yml).

If you are using JetBrains IDEs, you can also try the HTTP files in `docs/api/examples`.

In the even that KOsync gets additional features, it is very possible  
that new API endpoints will be created for some of those features.

For such a case, the goal is to keep API compatibility with the official Server.
